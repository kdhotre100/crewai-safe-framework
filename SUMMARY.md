# CrewAI SAFe 6.0 Framework Implementation - Summary

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a multi-agent system using CrewAI, structured according to the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) 6.0. The system consists of 25 AI agents organized in a hierarchical structure across three tiers:

- **Tier 0**: Executive leadership (Founder, CEO, CTO/CAI, CMO/CSO)
- **Tier 1**: Middle management and department heads
- **Tier 2**: Specialists and team members

Each agent has a specific role, goal, responsibilities, and meetings they attend, aligned with the SAFe 6.0 framework.

## Key Components

1. **Agent Structure**: 25 individual agent classes organized in a hierarchical structure
2. **Demo Scripts**: Multiple scripts demonstrating different aspects of agent collaboration
3. **Integration with OpenAI**: Using the `o3-mini` model for agent interactions

## Demo Scripts

### 1. Single Agent Demo (`src/demo_agent.py`)

This script demonstrates a simple interaction with the Founder agent, showing how to initialize an agent and ask it a question.

```bash
python -m src.demo_agent
```

### 2. Quick Multi-Agent Demo (`src/quick_multi_agent_demo.py`)

This script demonstrates a simple collaboration between the Founder and CEO agents, with the CEO building on the Founder's output.

```bash
python -m src.quick_multi_agent_demo
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Demo (`src/multi_agent_demo.py`)

This script demonstrates a more complex collaboration between the Founder, CEO, and CTO/CAI agents, with each agent building on the previous agent's output.

```bash
python -m src.multi_agent_demo
```

### 4. Hierarchical Demo (`src/hierarchical_demo.py`)

This script demonstrates a hierarchical interaction between agents from different tiers:
- Tier 2: AI Research Lead
- Tier 1: Technical Architecture Manager
- Tier 0: CTO/CAI

The information flows up the hierarchy, with each agent adding their expertise.

```bash
python -m src.hierarchical_demo
```

### 5. Agent Initialization Test (`src/test_agents.py`)

This script tests the initialization of all 25 agents, verifying that they have the correct roles, goals, responsibilities, and meetings.

```bash
python -m src.test_agents
```

## Key Features

1. **Hierarchical Structure**: Agents are organized in a hierarchical structure, with information flowing up and down the hierarchy.
2. **Task Dependencies**: Tasks can depend on the output of previous tasks, allowing for complex workflows.
3. **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a specialized role with specific responsibilities and goals.
4. **SAFe 6.0 Alignment**: The agent structure and interactions are aligned with the SAFe 6.0 framework.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-Functional Swarms**: Implement cross-functional teams of agents that can collaborate on specific tasks.
2. **Dynamic Task Assignment**: Allow for dynamic assignment of tasks based on agent availability and expertise.
3. **Performance Metrics**: Add metrics to track agent performance and task completion.
4. **Integration with External Systems**: Connect the agents to external systems for data retrieval and action execution.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of multi-agent systems for simulating organizational structures and workflows. By using CrewAI and the SAFe 6.0 framework, we've created a flexible and scalable system that can be adapted to various business scenarios.
